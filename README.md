# Hi, I'm Krik! 👋  

🚀 **Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Front-End Oriented)**  

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with **10+ years of experience**, strongly focused on **front-end architecture**, **performance and scalable UI systems**. I specialize in **React**, **Next.js**, **Angular** and **TypeScript**, and I work closely with backend services using **Node.js**, **NestJS** and **Fastify** to deliver reliable, production-grade applications.


## Projects I’ve Worked On Over the Years
Some of the projects I’ve worked on — and some I still work on today:

- **Next.js** – Defining front-end architecture for a CMS platform using Next.js, TypeScript and clean architectural patterns, while building a reusable component system with Radix UI, Tailwind, Atomic Design and Storybook by integrating it with Fastify / NestJS microservices.
